My software project for EEE 121 (Data Structures and Algorithms for Electrical and Electronics Engineering).

Given the initial starting position of a given piece, you will be asked to determine the
minimum number of moves needed to reach any position in the tile. 

The number in the output board is the number of minimum moves it will take for the chess piece
to reach the specific position. The starting position of the piece is marked as 0 and unreachable
tiles are marked as -1.

Milestone 1:

Output the board for the minimum moves it will take for the chess pieces (pawn, bishop, knight.
queen, rook) to reach a certain tile.

Disregard the rule wherein the pawn gets promoted or it can move two tiles at its first move.
